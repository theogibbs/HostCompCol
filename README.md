Code for the project "Coexistence of bacteria with a competition-colonization tradeoff on a dynamic coral host"

The file "0_Functions.R" contains functions for the scripts in the other files that run simulations. In "0_Functions.R", there are helper functions that return the ODEs of the model, integrate ODEs, compute eigenvalues, numerically solve for equilibria and so on.

The remaining files generate the corresponding figures in the main text. So, "1_HostEffect.R" runs the simulations and plots Figure 1. Each file has comments describing in more detail what the scripts are meant to do.
